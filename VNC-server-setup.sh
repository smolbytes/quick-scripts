#This script will setup one VNC session for the user the script is run as. You will need sudo to install the server, but not for any of the rest.
#Many distros include sym-links for "vncserver"; however I used the tigervncserver binaries directly to reduce ambiguity. You can modify as you see fit.
#This script assumes you want to use xfce as your desktop environment and already have it installed; to use GNOME/KDE/MATE etc, you will need different commands in your xstarup file in the user's home directory.

#
#TODO remove all known vnc servers and clients to prevent issues, if they exist on the system
